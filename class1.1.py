# These are sample exercises from the Girl Develop It: Intro to Python course!

# Exercise 1: simple print    print('I am a Python program')

# Exercise 2: more printing
#from __future__ import print_function #only enter this line if using Python2
#a = 34
#b = 47
# = a+b
#print(a," + ",b," = ", c)

# Exercise 3: user input
#d = raw_input("Enter the first number.")
#e = raw_input("Enter the second number.")
#f = int(d)+int(e) #we use the int() function to make d and e into integers instead of strings
#print(d," + ",e," = ", f)

# Exercise 4: 
#input_value = raw_input("Enter a radius: ")
#for Python 3.3 replace with input_value = input("Enter a radius: ")
#radius = float(input_value)
#area = 3.14159 * radius ** 2 # ** is "raised to the power"
#print("The area of a circle with radius "+input_value+"is: ")
#print(area)

# Let's Develop It Exercise
dessert = raw_input("What's your favorite type of dessert?")
coffee = raw_input("Would you like coffee with that? (some/no)")
print("Okay, I'll get you "+ dessert + " with "+coffee+" coffee!")
#  next week: if statement to offer other beverages if no one wants coffee

# idea - a program which takes a user's meal and suggests a wine pairing!
